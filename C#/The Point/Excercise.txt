The first pedestal asks you to create a Point class to store a point in two dimensions, each point is represented by an x and y coordinate
Define a Point class with properties x and y
add a constructor to create a point from a specific x and y coordinate
add a parameterless constructor to create a point at the origin (0,0)
In your main method, create a point at (2,3) and another at (-4,0), display them in the console in the (x, y) format to illustrate that the class works. 

Are your X and Y properties immutable? Why did you choose what you did?
